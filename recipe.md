Prepare the pizza sauce.
Get all your toppings ready.
Now prepare the dough.
When you check on it after 20 mins, it will have slightly puffed up. Take a sharp knife and make tiny slits all over the base.
Once you've made the slits, apply a coating of your pizza sauce as evenly as you can.
Now grate some cheese, mozzarella preferably, and sprinkle a light layer all over.
Now add your toppings one at a time.
